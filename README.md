Except where noted, create a new file for each function definition where the file name matches the function name. For example, you should create a `sum.js` file for the first question.

1. Define a function called `sum` that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum.

2. Define a function called `isEqual` that takes two arguments and returns a 
boolean. Return true if the two arguments are strictly equals and return false if they are not.

3. Define a function called `isDivisible` that takes two arguments and returns a boolean. Return true if the first argument is divisible by the second; otherwise, return false. (Note: A number is divisible by another if when divided the remainder is 0.)

4. Create a file called `event.js`. Define an event listener that alerts "His name is Robert Paulson." when triggered. The event listener should be registered on the `body` of the document. Before you define the event listener, you will need to select the body from the DOM. You can't assume anything unique about the HTML, so you need to select the body without reference to an ID, class, etc.
